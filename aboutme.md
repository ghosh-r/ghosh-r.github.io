Hi, I am [Ritobrata Ghosh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritobrata-ghosh/).

I am a Deep Learning Consultant based in Kolkata, India, currently working for a beverage company based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I am applying Computer Vision to solve a problem in a novel field.

I am an undergraduate student studying Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. I enjoy solving problems, and learning new things.

I am passionate about Deep Learning, especially **Vision**. I am fascinated about **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, and **Generative Adversarial Networks**. I am interested in cutting-edge research of these fields.

I am fairly active on Kaggle.

*I want to focus on solving real-world problems with Deep Learning. I am curious about fields and problems where Deep Learning can be applied in a novel manner.* I care deeply about "AI for good".

I love to swim. I read books- long engaging novels, and quality non-fictions, watch TV Series (“The Wire” is my favorite) for pleasure. I write, I am currently learning to play the piano (inspired by Chopin)! I am fluent in three languages (Bengali, English, Hindi), and learning two more (German, Spanish). Basically, I have too many hobbies and interests for my own good!
